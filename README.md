This repository has signal analysis GUIs for different signal operations in MATLAB. 

1. Amplitude operation  - performs signal addition, subtraction multiplication for two user generated signals as graphical inputs. 

2. Time operation - performs signal time shifting, scaling and reversal for user generated signal as graphical input. 

3. Conv1D: Performs 1D convolution on two user generated input signals in discrete time. 

4. Butterworth filter - Uses butterworth bandpass filter to convert the music input to high or low bass form. 

5. Noise removal - Uses adaptive filtering algorithm to generate noiseless signal.
